# Saverys — Complete Site Build: Master Reference

## What this document is

This is the single reference for the entire Saverys website build on Next.js / Netlify. It brings together six detailed Claude Code prompts created across multiple sessions, establishes the execution order, maps dependencies between them, and provides the business context that every prompt needs.

**Use this document as your CLAUDE.md project file.** Place it in the root of the Saverys repo so that every Claude Code session starts with full context.

## The business

**Saverys** (also written Savery's) is a luxury interior design studio established in 1942 by Lyndsey Savery. The practice specialises in hand upholstery, bespoke furniture, premium fabric sourcing, rugs, and full interior design services for private residences, country houses, and luxury hotels.

The brand identity is refined, understated British luxury. Think country house, not corporate. Confident but never loud. Editorial, not advertorial. The Cotswolds is not just a location — it's embedded in the aesthetic.

### Locations

| Location | Address | Phone |
|---|---|---|
| **Broadway (HQ + Workshop)** | Cotswold Design Centre, Kennel Lane, Broadway, Worcestershire, WR12 7DJ | 01386 858941 |
| **Ludlow** | 1 Tower Street, Ludlow, Shropshire, SY8 1RL | 01584 708381 |
| **Chelsea** | Suite 9, 405 Kings Road, Chelsea, London | 020 3668 1000 |

### Key facts

- Legal name: Lyndsey Savery Interior Design Ltd
- Founded: 1942
- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/saverysofbroadway/
- Production domain: `saverys.co.uk`
- Staging domain: `saverys.netlify.app`
- GA4 Property: `G-HEYQ32WKC0`
- Previous WordPress site: GoDaddy managed hosting (being replaced by this build)

### Primary competitor

**Pavilion Broadway** (pavilionbroadway.co.uk) — currently dominates "interior design Broadway" searches. They sell furniture; Saverys *makes* it. That distinction is Saverys' primary competitive advantage.

---

## Tech stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (deployed on Netlify)
- **CMS:** Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) — Git-based, stores content as markdown in `content/`
- **Content:** Markdown files with YAML frontmatter, parsed with `gray-matter` + `remark`
- **Hosting:** Netlify with Git Gateway for CMS authentication
- **Domain:** `saverys.co.uk` (DNS to be pointed to Netlify on go-live)
- **Analytics:** GA4 (`G-HEYQ32WKC0`) — no GTM, no other tracking
- **Search Console:** Already verified and indexing the WordPress site

---

## SEO target keywords (priority order)

1. `interior design Broadway` / `interior designer Broadway`

3. `luxury interior design Cotswolds`
4. `interior design Ludlow`
5. `bespoke upholstery Cotswolds`

7. `luxury fabrics Broadway Cotswolds`
8. `hand upholstery workshop Cotswolds`
9. `bespoke furniture Cotswolds`
10. `interior design studio Worcestershire`

## The six prompts — execution order

Each prompt is a self-contained Claude Code instruction file. They must be executed in this order because later prompts depend on infrastructure created by earlier ones.

### Phase 1: Foundation

#### Prompt 1 → `saverys-seo-implementation-prompt.md`
**What it does:** Implements the complete SEO infrastructure across the entire site — page-level metadata for every page, image alt text audit, JSON-LD structured data (Organisation, LocalBusiness ×3, WebSite, BreadcrumbList, Article, ImageGallery), dynamic XML sitemap, robots.txt, llms.txt, heading hierarchy, internal linking strategy, 404 page, Netlify headers, and WordPress migration redirects.

**Why it's first:** Every subsequent prompt assumes this SEO infrastructure exists. The structured data component, the sitemap generator, and the metadata patterns are referenced by later prompts.

**Key outputs:**
- Metadata on every page (title, description, OG, Twitter, canonical, geo)
- `<StructuredData>` component or `lib/schema.ts` utility
- `app/sitemap.ts` (dynamic sitemap)
- `public/robots.txt`
- `public/llms.txt` + `public/llms-full.txt`
- `app/not-found.tsx` (custom 404)
- `public/_redirects` or `netlify.toml` redirect rules
- `public/_headers` or `netlify.toml` cache headers

**Depends on:** Nothing — this is the starting point.

---

#### Prompt 2 → `saverys-ga4-search-console-prompt.md`
**What it does:** Adds GA4 tracking (`G-HEYQ32WKC0`) with environment-aware loading (only fires in production), Google Search Console verification, environment variable setup, and the migration redirect safety net for WordPress URLs.

**Why it's second:** GA4 and Search Console are infrastructure that should be in place before content pages are built, so tracking is verified early.

**Key outputs:**
- GA4 script in root layout (production-only)
- Search Console verification meta tag
- `.env.example`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` environment variables
- WordPress → Next.js redirect map in `public/_redirects`

**Depends on:** Prompt 1 (root layout must exist, redirects may overlap — merge rather than duplicate).

**Note on overlap:** Both Prompt 1 and Prompt 2 create redirect rules. When running Prompt 2, check if redirects already exist from Prompt 1 and merge them rather than overwriting. The combined redirect file should contain both the SEO redirects (trailing slashes, canonical paths) and the WordPress migration redirects.

---

### Phase 2: Content pages

#### Prompt 3 → `saverys-workshop-page-prompt.md`
**What it does:** Creates the Workshop & Store page at `/workshop` — hero section, introduction ("A Dying Art, Kept Alive in Broadway"), showroom section, workshop section, fabrics & rugs section, expert service section, and visit CTA with address and phone.

**Why it's third:** The Workshop page is referenced by journal articles (internal linking). It needs to exist before the Journal is built so those links work.

**Key outputs:**
- Workshop page component/route
- Workshop page added to navigation
- Images assigned from `public/`
- Full metadata and structured data on the page

**Depends on:** Prompt 1 (metadata patterns, structured data component), navigation component must be identified.

---

#### Prompt 4 → `saverys-journal-build-prompt.md`
**What it does:** Builds the entire Journal section — updates the Decap CMS config with new fields (pillar, alt text, SEO overrides), creates the content utility for reading markdown, builds the listing page at `/journal`, builds the dynamic post template at `/journal/[slug]`, adds Journal to the nav, creates the first article ("How to Choose Upholstery Fabric for a Country House"), and implements Article structured data on post pages.

**Why it's fourth:** The Journal section depends on the SEO infrastructure (Prompt 1), the GA4 tracking (Prompt 2), and the Workshop page existing for internal links (Prompt 3).

**Key outputs:**
- Updated `public/admin/config.yml` with enhanced journal fields
- `lib/journal.ts` (or equivalent content utility)
- Journal listing page (`/journal`)
- Journal post template (`/journal/[slug]`)
- Journal added to navigation
- First article in `content/journal/`
- Article JSON-LD on post pages

**Depends on:** Prompts 1–3. The first article links to `/workshop` — that page must exist.

---

#### Prompt 5 → `saverys-journal-articles-2-to-8.md`
**What it does:** Creates seven additional journal articles as markdown files in `content/journal/`, covering all five editorial pillars and all three locations. Assigns images from `public/` to each article.

**Why it's fifth:** The Journal infrastructure must be built (Prompt 4) before content can be added. This prompt adds articles into the existing system.

**Key outputs:**
- 7 markdown files in `content/journal/`:
  - `cotswold-design-centre-broadway.md` (Place — Broadway)
  - `commissioning-a-bespoke-sofa.md` (Craft)
  - `designing-for-a-cotswold-stone-house.md` (Place — Cotswolds)
  - `anatomy-of-a-hand-sprung-seat.md` (Craft)
  - `how-we-approach-a-new-project.md` (Design)
  - `guide-to-natural-upholstery-fabrics.md` (Fabric)
  - `ludlow-design-lovers-guide.md` (Place — Ludlow)

**Depends on:** Prompt 4 (journal section must be built and rendering correctly).

---

### Phase 3: Strategy reference (not code — editorial guide)

#### Prompt 6 → `saverys-journal-content-strategy.md`
**What it does:** Defines the ongoing editorial strategy — voice and tone guidelines, five content pillars with topic ideas and keyword targets, publishing cadence (2 per month), the full launch sequence of 12 articles, SEO rules for every article, competitive gaps to exploit, and distribution/measurement guidance.

**This is not a Claude Code prompt — it's a strategy document.** Keep it in the repo as a reference for anyone writing future content. Suggested location: `docs/journal-content-strategy.md` or the project root.

**Depends on:** Nothing — it's a reference document, not executable code.

## Go-live day checklist

When you're ready to point `saverys.co.uk` to Netlify:

### DNS and domain

- [ ] Update DNS A/CNAME records to point to Netlify (follow Netlify's domain setup guide)
- [ ] Add `saverys.co.uk` as a custom domain in Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Enable HTTPS / SSL certificate in Netlify (automatic via Let's Encrypt)
- [ ] Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, usually much faster)
- [ ] Confirm `https://saverys.co.uk` loads the new Next.js site

### Environment variables

- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-HEYQ32WKC0` in Netlify environment variables (production context)
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://saverys.co.uk` in Netlify environment variables
- [ ] Trigger a production redeploy after setting variables

### GA4 verification

- [ ] Visit `https://saverys.co.uk` in a browser
- [ ] Open Google Analytics → Reports → Realtime
- [ ] Confirm you appear as an active user within 30 seconds
- [ ] Check that only `G-HEYQ32WKC0` is firing (no old tags)

### Search Console

- [ ] Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
- [ ] Confirm ownership verification is still active for `saverys.co.uk`
- [ ] If verification dropped, re-verify using the HTML meta tag method
- [ ] Go to Sitemaps → delete old WordPress sitemap if listed
- [ ] Submit new sitemap: `https://saverys.co.uk/sitemap.xml`
- [ ] Wait for confirmation — should show "Success" with page count

### Request indexing

- [ ] In Search Console → URL Inspection, submit each key page:
  - `https://saverys.co.uk/`
  - `https://saverys.co.uk/history`
  - `https://saverys.co.uk/portfolio`
  - `https://saverys.co.uk/workshop`
  - `https://saverys.co.uk/journal`
  - `https://saverys.co.uk/contact`
  - `https://saverys.co.uk/journal/choosing-upholstery-fabric-country-house`

### Smoke test

- [ ] Visit every page on the live domain — no 404s, no broken images, no console errors
- [ ] Test redirects on the live domain (`/our-history` → `/history` etc.)
- [ ] Test the CMS at `https://saverys.co.uk/admin`
- [ ] Submit a test rich results check at Google: `https://search.google.com/test/rich-results?url=https://saverys.co.uk`

### WordPress decommission

- [ ] Once everything is confirmed working, you can decommission the WordPress site on GoDaddy
- [ ] Keep the GoDaddy database backup from 23 March (`backup-20260323.sql`) stored safely
- [ ] Do NOT delete the GoDaddy hosting immediately — keep it as a fallback for 30 days
- [ ] After 30 days with no issues, cancel the GoDaddy hosting

## Launch Day Runbook

Execute in order. Do not skip steps.

1. Final Netlify build green on `main`
2. DNS flip:
   - Apex `saverys.co.uk`: A record → Netlify load balancer IP, OR ALIAS/ANAME → `[netlify-site].netlify.app`
   - `www.saverys.co.uk`: CNAME → `[netlify-site].netlify.app`
3. Wait for Netlify auto-SSL provisioning (typically <10 min, occasionally up to 1 hour)
4. Set Netlify primary domain to `saverys.co.uk` (apex), www → apex redirect
5. Verify env vars in Netlify production context:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://saverys.co.uk`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-HEYQ32WKC0`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=...`
   - `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=...`
5a. Run smoke test against deploy preview (canonical pre-merge gate):
    ```
    npm run smoke -- https://[preview-url]
    ```
    All checks must pass before promoting to production.
5b. Manual contact form test on deploy preview:
    - Submit with Turnstile completed → confirm receipt in Netlify Forms inbox
    - Submit via curl/Postman without token → confirm 400 response
    - Confirm GA4 `form_submit` event fires (Realtime view)
6. Smoke test on production:
   - Homepage, three showroom pages, contact form, journal index, projects index
   - View source: confirm canonicals and OG URLs use saverys.co.uk
6a. Run automated production smoke test:
    ```
    npm run smoke:prod
    ```
    All checks must pass.
7. GA4 Realtime — confirm session fires from your visit
8. Search Console:
   - Verify domain via DNS TXT
   - Submit `https://saverys.co.uk/sitemap.xml`
9. Bing Webmaster Tools — same
10. Test 8–10 legacy WordPress URLs return 301:
    - `/our-portfolio`, `/our-history`, `/contact/`, `/feed`, `/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/test.jpg`, `/privacy-policy/`, `/wp-login.php`, `/wp-admin/`
11. Run Rich Results Test on:
    - `/`, `/about`, `/showroom/broadway`, `/showroom/ludlow`, `/projects`, `/projects/[any-slug]`, `/journal/[any-slug]`
12. PageSpeed Insights baseline — record LCP, CLS, INP for `/`, `/projects`, `/showroom/broadway`
13. GA4 Admin — mark `form_submit`, `phone_click`, `email_click`, `directions_click` as conversions
14. Send launch confirmation to Gary with link to start GBP setup × 3 locations

## Outstanding (non-code)

- **OG JPG asset**: Replace `/og-image.webp` reference in `app/layout.tsx`
  (search for the `TODO: replace with /og-default.jpg` comment) with
  `/og-default.jpg` once Gary supplies the 1200×630 JPG. Improves LinkedIn
  share rendering specifically.

- **Alt text backfill** for `saverys-1` through `saverys-4` project hero
  images. Suggested format for Gary:
  > "[Project name] interior — [room type] in [location]"
  > Example: "Saverys 1 interior — drawing room in a Cotswold country house"

  Edit via Decap CMS at `/admin` → Projects. See
  `audit-reports/alt-text-backfill-guide.md` for the placeholder list.

- **Turnstile**: create a Cloudflare Turnstile site for `saverys.co.uk` (and
  `localhost` for dev) and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` and
  `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` in Netlify production env vars.

- **Search Console + Bing Webmaster**: verify domain and submit sitemap
  post-DNS-flip.

- **Google Business Profile**: × 3 locations (Broadway HQ, Ludlow, Chelsea).
